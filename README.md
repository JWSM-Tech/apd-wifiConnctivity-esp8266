# adding WiFi Connctivity using the ESP8266 WiFi Module (NodeMCU) to the Automatic Pill Dispenser Project

This repository holds the ESP8266 configurations for the Automatic Pill Dispenser project

The Automatic Pill Dispenser project is using ESP8266 WiFi Module (NodeMCU)

The NodeMCU is running at 115200 Baud Rate, in order to interface with it

The chosen microcontroller's UART is configured to run at the same Baud Rate as the NodeMCU
